## Career Changers: Valuable Advice On Preparing For Job Interviews

Raise your hand if you find talking about yourself really uncomfortable. But as awkward as it might be, being able to communicate well your personality, skills, and experience in behavioral and technical interviews is something that you have to harness if you want to get hired. Here are some tips that proved useful to me.

### Continue To Learn

I was aware that my skill level was very much that of a beginner, so I understood that I needed to carry on learning. I went back to basics and started over. I read and watched tutorials and brushed up on things I knew I wasn’t very at ease with yet. I also registered myself to online daily coding exercises on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), which was like hitting 3 birds at the same time. While I practiced and improved on my coding and problem-solving skills, I was also able to make regular commits to my GitHub account (to show my diligence and commitment) and have some materials to write about for [my technical blog on HashNode](https://beforeforty.hashnode.dev/). This has been my main weekday routine for some time, and I would spend the weekend on personal projects. These really helped to boost my confidence going into interviews. 

### Build An Online Presence

Being on LinkedIn and GitHub is already a given. If everybody has it, then it doesn’t really make you stand out. So aside from making sure that these accounts were up-to-date and conveyed the promising developer I wanted recruiters to see, I figured I could be noticed more by creating a blog where I talk about the things I have been learning. Being able to effectively communicate and document your approach to a problem is something really valuable in the tech industry, so showcasing this skill through my blog was a very good exercise. Plus, it was something interesting to talk about during interviews.

### Be Bold 

Rejections have a way of crushing us so we do not feel motivated anymore to pursue our goals. However, responding in exactly the opposite way is the challenge. I used to spend a day or two feeling bad about being rejected and thinking about what I did wrong or should have done differently. But after that, I make sure to get back on the saddle and send out an application. In fact, some of the jobs I applied for I didn’t have a clue what they were about. We sometimes steer away from opportunities when we hear that knowledge or experience in technologies we haven’t tinkered with before are required, but really there is some benefit to just trying things out for the sake of it. 

Once I had put in an application for an intermediate developer role at an insurance company that uses Java, even though I am nowhere close to being at that level and I have never coded in Java before. I relied on the fact that it was an insurance company and I had worked in one before so, maybe, I will figure it out somehow. Surprisingly, I made it to the last stage of the recruitment process and even almost got the job as per feedback. Because of that opportunity, I was forced to learn Java in less than a week for the technical interview, and I gained some experience interviewing for an intermediate role and obtained insights as to the kinds of questions asked. I took every interview as a golden chance to practice and be compelled to learn something I would not otherwise voluntarily venture on at the time.

### Welcome Unique Opportunities

Since coming to New Zealand, I have been presented with so many opportunities I could only wish for in the Philippines. While waiting to hear about my job applications, I got an invitation to take part in the [AWS She Builds Hāpori Wāhine CloudUp Program](https://awswahinehapori-shebuildsloudup.splashthat.com/). It was an initiative intended for women in NZ who want to learn about cloud technology, particularly AWS services, and culminated in getting certified as cloud practitioners. It was a rare chance to study and take the certification exam for free. You could do online, self-paced, and you also get access to experts in the field. At the end of the program, everyone graduates and is bridged to potential employers. It was too good to be true, but it was the real deal. Through the program, I was able to increase my knowledge on cloud technology and have a broader understanding about networking, cybersecurity, databases, and cloud architecture. It is one of those opportunities that is hard to take a pass on. 

At about the same time that I was doing the AWS program, I received an invitation to apply for a solutions specialist role through [Summer of Tech](https://www.summeroftech.co.nz/), an internship program helping NZ companies connect with technology students in engineering, design, computer science or any other tech-related field. It was also a great opportunity to pursue the path of a solutions architect. Since I was coincidentally in the process of getting certified as an AWS Cloud Practitioner, there seemed to be an alignment between the role and my current learning efforts. So I interviewed for it, and I was seriously entertaining the possibility of taking a different path to development. But as chance would have it, I received a better offer to work as a grad engineer at my dream employer. In the final research and presentation, which was part of the hiring process there, I was able to make use of my new cloud knowledge to show my understanding of technology, and it really helped me make an impression.

### Prepare For The Expected And The Unexpected

Ages ago back in university, I competed for an inter-school extemporaneous speaking contest. I was trained by an experienced coach, and I will never forget how much he emphasized on preparation. He used to say that with good preparation, the battle is won before the fight. Although I later realized he only borrowed it from Sun Tzu’s *The Art of War*, the point is that this same principle is handy when it comes to preparing for job interviews. Whenever I have one coming up, I make sure to do prior research about the company, their values, the role, feedback from applicants about their experience interviewing for them, among others. Also, common questions such as *what will you bring into the role* and *why will you be a good fit for the organization* are just some of the things you should prepare answers for. If you cannot give coherent responses to these expected, basic questions, then it might be a bit of a hurdle coming back from this setback. Going into interviews prepared will give you some confidence. I personally find that it somehow calms my nerves and helps me be more comfortable in presenting my authentic self.

Of course, you will not be able to anticipate all the questions that would be asked. But as you gain more experience interviewing for different roles at different companies, you will gain more insight as to what questions will likely be asked. I had experienced many times feeling that the interviewer was not really prepared with their questions. It was as if they were just pulled out from work that day and just quickly perused my resume to be able to come up with last-minute questions. So, at the very least, be ready to expound more on the skills, qualifications, and experience you have written on your resume.

### Have A Mentor

I truly admire people who are able to figure things out by themselves. And certainly, there is almost nothing these days that you cannot just google or find a resource on YouTube. But if you can enlist the help of a mentor, I would highly suggest doing so. They do not have to be someone who will personally instruct you on how to code, although you would be lucky if you have access to one. At the very least, a mentor is someone you can talk to about your plans and who can possibly share valuable advice on what steps to take or roadmap to follow so you will achieve your goals. Once in a while, it would be good to catch up with them to assess your progress and what strategic actions you can do next. In fact, they might also be able to connect you with people who were in the same situation as you when they started their journey in tech.

These suggestions are not exclusive. With more experience interviewing for jobs, you will discover what things work for you and what don’t. You will find that, in time, you will get better at it and the answers will just come out naturally. Having structure and coordination in your efforts overall is crucial because time is precious, especially for career changers like me.
