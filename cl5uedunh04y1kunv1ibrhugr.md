## Becoming A Developer: Shifting To A Tech Role Before 40

As a career changer previously working in insurance and in a government agency, I felt I have heaps of transferable skills that are highly important in a tech role, particularly problem-solving, communication, organization, and people skills. Thus, I was quite positive that, like so many people who have successfully transitioned to the tech industry, I, too, can make it happen. But as to when or what it entails to actually land a job, I was completely naïve.

After finishing a web development bootcamp, my struggle to get hired for a tech role was real. I had to deal with plenty of application rejections and a couple of almost-hired (but they prefer a junior engineer with more experience and/or a university computer science degree). In some, I would pass the behavioral interview only to be found wanting in the technical interview. This, one after the other, really crushed my morale and motivation, and I doubted many times if my decision to change careers was actually a wise choice.

### Coming To New Zealand & Career Hiatus

For a good 5 years, I worked as an insurance adviser and unit manager at AXA Philippines, and it was something I really enjoyed and loved particularly because of the value I brought to my clients’ financial well-being and preparedness. But in 2018, my husband and I decided to move to NZ with our 2 kids in the hopes of giving them access to better opportunities in the future. With no work experience in my new country, I was so happy to land a role in the Department of Corrections working as an electronic monitoring bail administrator, working closely with staff from court, prison, and the police. It was practically Kiwi 101 to me while at the same time helping to keep NZ safe. 

My time there, however, was interrupted because my daughter got diagnosed with leukemia and had to undergo chemotherapy treatment for over 2 years. As my husband is the main income earner in the family, we decided for me to take a break from work so I can focus on taking care of our precious little girl. Thankfully, she is now well and living her best life. Her healing came at the most perfect time for me career-wise because something unexpected came along.

### Studying Web Development

After a year since I resumed work at the Department of Corrections, doors opened for me to learn to code for free, which I have considered for some time being surrounded by friends who are relentless in encouraging me to shift to a tech career – it is challenging, financially sustainable, and offers great flexibility and better opportunities for career advancement. Due to the depressing effects of the pandemic on the economy, the NZ government decided to extend the [Targeted Training and Apprenticeship Fund (TTAF)](https://www.careers.govt.nz/courses/funding-study-and-training/ttaf/) to industry training programs such as web development, which made it possible for me to save almost NZD 10,000 in tuition! Having heard of real-people stories of career shifters successfully pivoting into tech, I left my day job and enrolled myself in a web development bootcamp at [Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/). 

In the first month, I learned foundational concepts before diving right into coding. Not long after, I was already building web applications with my teammates and consistently learning new technologies each week for the next 3 to 4 months. At that time, it had been over 13 years since I last finished university. I felt rusty, but it was compensated by the stimulating academic environment I found myself in once more and being around so many bright mix of people and brilliant instructors. The training was everything they said it was going to be – fast-paced, demanding, yet supportive. 

But to be honest, I wrestled with a lot in those months. First of all, the schedule was tough for me. Although there was an option to do it online, I made myself present onsite each day because I knew that being around people and interacting with my cohort in person was something extra I wouldn’t get so much otherwise. Learning with others is also a skill that is very valuable in the actual workplace, and I knew I needed the experience. But this meant leaving home so early in the morning and coming home late in the day. In those months, my husband covered school drop-off and pick-up, making dinner, and so much more. If I didn’t have the level of support I had, it would have been nearly impossible for me to finish the course. 

The other thing I struggled with was learning (again) and how fast-paced the lessons were. Not having any prior experience in coding, I found it really difficult at first to understand the exercises and write my own code. I really wished I could have prepared more before doing the actual course, particularly the basics of how to code. The learning curve was so steep in my case that it was only towards the later part of the program when everything started to click. There was not much time to supplement my learning with online tutorials because before you can even consolidate your learning from the previous week, there’s already something new to learn for the next one. There was just so much information to take in that no matter how much you want to absorb everything, it was just a little too overwhelming. Now I don’t want to use the age card, but to be completely honest, it was initially so grueling for me to learn so many complex new things at the same time at 39. I don’t know how others start to learn to code at a much later age, but they are hands down incredible for not giving up. I am just happy the concept of the [Growth Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiEeMN7vbQ) convinced me at the onset that it is possible.  

One very important thing that I developed in the process is learning agility. As someone who likes to wrap her head around a concept fully before moving to the next thing, the speed of transitioning from one lesson to another really made me extremely uncomfortable. But what I did not realize then was that it trained me to learn things fast, which should get me up to pace with the rate that technology is changing and prepare me for what it’s going to be like when I finally join the industry. In addition, I learned that if there is anything that is not clear to me, I am accountable to supplement my learning in ways that I know works for me.

Amidst my learning struggles, I found so much support from my cohort and the teachers. Because we each came from different backgrounds, with varying skills and experience, I never felt ashamed of my limited knowledge, or embarrassed when I asked stupid questions, or hesitated to ask for help. I felt it was a completely safe environment to be honest about what I knew and did not know. The program comes with a really engaging human skills course, which really helped me come to terms with my limitations and taught me how to work effectively with others. 

### The Realities of Job Hunting

When I finally finished the course in December 2021, and after taking a much-needed break during the Christmas holidays, the search for a job in tech began. It didn’t take long for me to be noticed by recruiters. In my CV, I was able to highlight the transferable skills I gained from prior work experience and how they would be useful in the roles I was applying for. In behavioral interviews, I anchored on my values and leaned on my communication skills, and I can say it is one area that I am quite confident about. But my nemesis was technical interviews, which often got me nervous and rattled – totally not a good formula for success in job interviews. I had to figure out a way to boost my confidence so I do not crumble under pressure. I have laid out some suggestions in [New To Tech: Valuable Advice On Preparing for Job Interviews](https://beforeforty.hashnode.dev/new-to-tech-valuable-advice-on-preparing-for-job-interviews) based on my experience.

### Landing a Job and What’s Next

Getting a job offer less than a year after I quit my job was such a relief. It seemed to me as if I finally received a concrete affirmation from the universe that I made the right decision. I remember what an agony it was waiting for 5 days to hear if I had made the cut or not. And when I learned of the wonderful news, after all the celebration and the adrenaline high subsided, it hit me, what now? Then I realized that I am, once more, at the start of another journey. For someone whose background is JavaScript and web development, I have very little knowledge and no experience in the tech my new organization is using, C# and .NET, AWS and the cloud. Although I have received some reassurance that I will be learning these on the job together with my cohort and there will be so much support available, I still feel compelled to do some preparatory studies so I can hit the ground running, so to speak. And then there’s the thought of working with new people and building relationships again. 

I have always been eager for challenges. But my experience in the past year had really tested my commitment to my goals. A year ago, I only dreamed of working in tech, unaware of what it really entails to get from zero to being a developer. The entire process wasn’t smooth-sailing, but the struggles made the outcome truly a sweet success.
