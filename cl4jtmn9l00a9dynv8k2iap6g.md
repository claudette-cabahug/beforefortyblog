## Understanding Matrixes And Submatrixes

Prior to encountering this problem, I have never worked with matrixes before. Reading through it and exploring the sample inputs, I only understood them to be an array of arrays. But as to how to move elements of one array so that they would end up in a desired position, or how to move them around several times to achieve the same, it was something really new to me.

So I approached the problem by first reading about matrixes and studying other people's published blogs about it. Some were really instructive and helpful. Here, I would like to present my own solution to the Hacker Rank problem entitled Flipping Matrix.

### The Problem

You are given a 2n x 2n matrix with each cell containing an integer. A sample input looks like this:

```
let matrix1 = [
[112, 42, 83, 119],
[56, 125, 56, 49],
[15, 78, 101, 43],
[62, 98, 114, 108]
]
```
Each quadrant (n x n) would contain the following integers:


![matrices.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657621474518/y-xSoHmMB.jpg align="left")

- Upper-left: 112, 42, 56, 125
- Upper-right: 83, 119, 56, 49
- Lower-left: 15, 78, 62, 98
- Lower-right: 101, 43, 114, 108

You can reverse any of the rows or columns any number of times so that the sum of the elements in the upper-left quadrant is maximal. 

### The Algorithm

The reversing of rows and columns basically all boils down to this idea: each integer in the upper-left quadrant can be replaced or retained, provided they are the highest possible integer that can be placed in their position after comparing them with other candidates in the other quadrants.

![flipping illustration.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657621490598/KpXQ6NlaZ.jpg align="left")

For instance, the candidates for 112's position would be 119, 62, and 108. Since 119 is the highest integer among them, you reverse the positions of 112 and 119. 

Next, the candidates for 42's position would be 83, 98, and 114. Since 114 is the highest integer among them, you reverse the column and then the row so that 114 would be able to switch position with 42.

Here, 56 and 125 will have to stay in their positions because they are already the highest integers among their respective candidates, as follows:

- 56: 49, 15, 43
- 125: 56, 78, 101

Thus, after all the intentional and strategic reversing is done, the integers that should be in the upper-left quadrant are 119, 114, 56, and 125, which would return the maximal sum of 414.

### The Code

Now, how to put this into code? I started by having a reference to the matrixes. I declared a variable referring to the length of the entire matrix, and then another variable referring to the length of the sub-matrixes, which is basically half of the length of the entire matrix.

  ```
  let matrixL = matrix.length
  let submatrixL = matrix.length / 2
```

I also needed, a variable to hold the total of the integers that would end up in the upper-left quadrant. 

```
  let total = 0
```

I, then, proceeded to iterate through the rows and columns of each sub-matrix, and each time, comparing the highest number in the sub-matrix to a maximum number. For starters, I used [Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/NEGATIVE_INFINITY) so that I have something to compare the first resulting number to. Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY can include negative numbers, so it is a wise property to use because it makes the code more scalable, as opposed to using [Number.MIN_VALUE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MIN_VALUE), which would not account for cases wherein negative numbers are included as inputs.

By iterating through this process, I was able to arrive at a set of integers that would provide the maximum possible sum.

```
function flippingMatrix(matrix) {
  let matrixL = matrix.length
  let submatrixL = matrix.length / 2
  let total = 0

  for (let r = 0; r < submatrixL; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < submatrixL; c++) {
      let max = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY 

      max = Math.max(matrix[r][c], max)    
      max = Math.max(matrix[r][matrixL - c - 1], max) 
      max = Math.max(matrix[matrixL - r - 1][c], max)  
      max = Math.max(matrix[matrixL - r - 1][matrixL - c - 1], max)  

      total += max
    }
  }

  return total
}
``` 
### Key Skills

In this exercise, I was able to practise applying for loop to a problem and make use of identifying positions in terms of columns and rows. In addition, I found it a challenge to make one's code scalable, meaning not hard-coding lengths and rows and columns. The code above will work just fine regardless of the number of integers in the matrixes.
